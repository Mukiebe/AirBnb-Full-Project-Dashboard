# Airbnb Data Visualization and Market Insights 
In my first project, I used Tableau to analyze Airbnb data, exploring average prices by bedroom count and zip code, listing availability, and yearly revenue trends. The dashboard reveals key market insights to guide pricing, investment, and seasonal strategy decisions.
Dataset used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle

1. Avg Price per Bedroom (Top-Left Bar Chart)
Question: How does the average price of a listing vary depending on the number of bedrooms?
The usefulness of the information:
This chart helps property owners, analysts, or potential investors understand pricing trends based on room capacity. It reveals the premium associated with more significant properties.
Conclusion:
•	Listings with more bedrooms generally command a higher average price.
•	There's a steady increase from 1-bedroom ($95.7) up to 6-bedroom listings ($578.2), with a slight drop for 7-bedroom listings ($375), possibly due to rarity or lower demand.
•	Sweet spots for price-to-bedroom ratio may exist at 5–6 bedrooms.

2. Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings (Top-Right Table)
Question: How many listings exist for each bedroom count?
The usefulness of the information:
It gives insights into the supply availability by bedroom count, which can guide market entry strategies and highlight which types of listings are most common or competitive.
Conclusion:
•	1-bedroom listings dominate the market (2,417), followed by 2-bedroom listings (640).
•	Listings with 4+ bedrooms are much less frequent, especially 6 and 7 (only 6 and 1 listings, respectively).
•	The high price for 6-bedroom listings may be due to scarcity.

3. Price by Zip Code (Bottom-Left Bar Chart)
Question: How does the average price of Airbnb listings vary across different zip codes?
The usefulness of the information:
Helps localize demand and pricing trends, identifying high-value areas for investment or pricing strategy optimization.
Conclusion:
•	Zip code 98199 has the highest average price, followed by 98119 and 98102.
•	Zip codes toward the right (e.g., 98108, 98112) show lower average prices, potentially indicating lower-demand areas or more affordable lodging.

5. Revenue for the Year (Bottom-Right Line Graph)
Question: How has total revenue changed over the course of the year?
The usefulness of the information:
Understanding seasonal trends, tracking business growth, or planning for marketing/promotion during high/low seasons is helpful.
Conclusion:
•	Revenue steadily increases from the start of the year and peaks mid-year (around May-August).
•	A slight dip is seen before a rebound at the end of the year.
•	This suggests a seasonal peak in summer, which aligns with tourist activity.
